#  Smart Material Price Monitor Agent 
**Kaggle Google AI Agents Capstone Project 2025 - Leonhard Satria Suharjo**

## My project in one sentence.
An enterprise AI agent system that monitors component prices across suppliers for an IOT manufacturing company. The system helps maintain profit margins on tender commitments by detecting price spikes before they impact production costs.

### Real world correlation and motivation 
As someone who is interested and engaged in device and manufacturing business model, I have noticed that projects undertook by companies often take months of work involving multiple processes such as tender, designing, testing, evaluation, mass production and more. As companies had to often commit to a specific price they submitted by the time of the project tender which is done months in advance to project execution. Due to this nature, I am motivated to start this prototype project that will help companies to monitor risks in prices of components involved in their project, minimizing loss risk.   

### Background knowledge 
This project is submitted as a part of the Kaggle and Google AI Agents intensive course November 2025. Thus, I wil be applying what I learned from the program into this capstone project including involving key concepts into a chosen project track.
